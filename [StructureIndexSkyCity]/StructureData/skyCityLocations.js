    description:
      'Q1 Tower has long become not just a high-rise dominant, but a point through which the entire urban space of the coast is perceived. Its form is read from different distances and angles, changing depending on the light, clouds and time of day. The building does not press with scale, but on the contrary creates a vertical balance between the ocean and dense buildings. Inside, the structure is organized so that the space remains calm, even when the city lives at a fast pace outside. Q1 does not strive to be an aggressive symbol; it works as a landmark that helps to read the city, even for first-time visitors. Its presence forms a sense of height not as a record, but as part of the city’s breathing.',

Inside, the logic of space is built around privacy and silence, which is rarely associated with height. Australia 108 shows how modern high-rise architecture can be restrained and calm.',
